# Transformers-For-Negation-and-Speculation
This is the code for the following papers:
* [NegBERT: A Transfer Learning Approach for Negation Detection and Scope Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04211)
* [Resolving the Scope of Speculation and Negation using Transformer-Based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02885)

Code has been utilized from the following sources:
* The starter code was taken from [this article on Named Entity Recognition with Bert](https://www.depends-on-the-definition.com/named-entity-recognition-with-bert/).  
* To be able to implement XLNetForTokenClassification and RobertaForTokenClassification for the [Transformers library by Huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), some code was copy-pasted from that code base.  
* The implementation of Early Stopping for PyTorch was adapted from [Bjarten's implementation(GitHub)](https://github.com/Bjarten/early-stopping-pytorch/blob/master/pytorchtools.py).

The colab notebook can be executed directly from Google Colaboratory.
